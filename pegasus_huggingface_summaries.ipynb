              "' SECTION 1. Title\\n This measure shall be la\\'iown as\"The California Scliools and Local Communities Funding Act of 2020.\"\\n SEC. 2. Findings\\n (a) California is the fiftl\"i largest economy in the world, but if we don\\'t invest in our future, we\\'ll fall beliind. To grow orir economy and provide a better qriality of life now, and for future generations of Californians, we need to do a better job of investing in orir schools, comrmuiity colleges, and local communities, and do more to encourage small businesses and stait-ups.\\n (b)\\n (c)\\n (d)\\n (e)\\n (f)\\n Our competitiveness begins witli making cliildren and their education a priority. Decades of cuts and underfunding liave undermined California schools. A recent national study ranked the performance of California schools in the bottom half of all states. The top ranked states spend tl\\'iousands of dollars more per student than California.\\n California\\'s funding sl\\'iortfall lias direct consequences for our kids: we\\'re dead last in tlie nation in teaclier-to-student ratios, last in guidance counselor to student ratios, and last in librarian-to-student ratios.\\n Tlie qriality of life in orir local comnaiunities is also critical to orir economic future. It depends on streets that are safe and clean, emergency services we can corint on, parks and recreation programs tliat keep orir youtli off the streets, and roads tliat are well\\n maintained. Our cities, corinties and local agencies are on the front line facing the consequences of tlie lack of affordable housing and increasing homelessness as well as worsening risks from wildfires and otlier disasters.\\n Property taxes on commercial and industrial properties are a principal sorirce of funding for our schools and local communities. While virtually every other state assesses commercial and industrial property based on its fair market value, California allows commercial and industrial propeity taxes to go many years, even decades, withorit reassessment. This unusual system is prone to abusive tax avoidance schemes, diveits funds away from schools and local communities, contributes to the sliortage of affordable housing, distoits business competition, and disadvantages business stait-ups.\\n California\\'s rinder-assessn\\'ient of commercial and industrial properties is a growing problem. Large investors and corporations, many of wliom are from other states and countries, are rising a variety of scliemes to get arorind the law and buy and sell propeities witliorit being reassessed, costing our scliools and local communities billions of dollars.\\n (g) A recent study by the University of Soutliern California has found tliat under-assessed commercial and industrial propeity allows owners to avoid over $11 billion in local\\n property taxes each year that shorild be going to suppoit our schools and local communities.\\n  (h) California\\'s rinusual commercial and industrial property tax system contributes to California\\'s affordable housing crisis. Studies by the Legislative Analyst Office and the University of California liave demonstrated that California\\'s property tax system incentivizes owners to hold idle vacant and under-utilized commercial and industrial property. A reformed system, that assesses all properties based on tlieir fair market\\n  value, would create a powerful new incentive to build new horising.\\n  (i) Every commercial and industrial property owner benefits from local schools and services like priblic safety and infrastrricture. It is unfair and anti-competitive that tlie propeity tax system forces some businesses to pay liigher propeity taxes to suppoit orir scliools and local communities wliile their competitors pay much lower propeity taxes because their properties are assessed far below tl\\'ieir fair market value.\\n  (j) California\\'s ruuisual propeity tax system not only distoits competition, it discorirages business investments. Under tlie current system, businesses that invest in improving tlieir propeities trigger reassessment and liiglier propeity taxes. But businesses tliat don\\'t\\n  invest in improving their properties contimie to enjoy tlie low cost of under assessment.\\n  (k) A study done at the University of California demonstrates that reassessing commercial propeity will have a net positive benefit on jobs and the California economy.\\n  (l) If we reformed California\\'s under-assessment problem on business properties, California would still rank among tlie lowest states for business propeity taxes in tlie nation becarise\\n  of the Califomia Constitution\\'s provisions related to tl\\'ie 1% limitation 011 propeity tax rates.\\n  (m)Thriving small businesses and start-ups are essential to California\\'s economy now and for our future. Tlie property tax on equipn\\'ient and fixtures discourages new start-ups, small businesses and larger businesses from making new productive investments. By reqriiring under-assessed large propeities to be assessed at fair market value, small businesses can be fully exempted from tlie propeity tax on equipment and fixtures and tlie tax can be substantially reduced for other businesses, removing tl\\'iis disincentive withorit harm to funding for orir schools and local commrinities.\\n  (n) Reassessing ru\\'ider-assessed commercial and industrial propeity in California worild primarily impact a small number of propeities owned by the largest corporations and wealthiest investors. Almost 80% of tlie tax benefits of the under-assessment allowed by the current system go to just 8% of tlie properties.\\n  (o) The benefits to orir schools, local communities and economy resulting from ending the under-assessment of comn\\'iercial and industrial property can be achieved wliile protecting small businesses throrigli exemptions and deferrals of reassessment and at the same time encouraging small businesses by creating a more level playing field and by eliminating\\n  tlie propeity tax on business eqriipment and fixtures.\\n   (p) Refonning commercial and industrial propeity assessments to fair market value will result in a fairer system for our schools, our local communities and our businesses. All businesses will compete on a level playing field, generating billions of dollars in additional support for orir schools and local communities.\\n   SEC. 3. Purpose and Intent.\\n   It is tlie intent of the People of tlie State of California to do all of tl\\'ie following in this measure:\\n   (a) Preserve in every way Proposition 13\\'s protections for liomeowners and for residential rental propeities. Tliis measure only affects the assessment of taxable commercial and industrial property.\\n   (b) Provide for increased and stable revenues for schools, cities, corinties and other local agencies by reqriiring ruider-assessed commercial and industrial propeities to be assessed based on their fair market value.\\n   (c) Distribute tlie new revenues resulting from this measure to scl\\'iools and local communities, not to tlie State.\\n   (d) Ensure tliat tlie portion of any new revenues going to local SCIIOOIS and community colleges as a result of tliis measure is treated as new revenues that are in addition to all otlier funding for scliools and comrminity colleges, including Proposition 98.\\n   (e)\\n   (f)\\n   (g)\\n   Guarantee every scliool district and community college will receive additional funding from this measure and that funds going to schools and community colleges are allocated in a mai\\'u\\'ier that is consistent witl\\'i local control funding formulas intended to advance equity.\\n   Ensure tliat any new revenues going to cities, counties, and special districts as a result of tliis measure will be allocated in tlie same maru\"ier as other property tax revenues,\\n   consistent with prior ballot measures approved by voters, to improve the qriality of life in local commrinities in all parts of California.\\n   Make ceitain tliere is complete priblic transparency by reqriiring scliools, community colleges, cities, corinties, and special districts to publicly disclose tlie new revenues they receive and liow tliose revenues are spent in a manner that is widely available and easily rinderstood.\\n   (h) Be very clear tliat tl\"iis measure only applies to taxable commercial and industrial real propeity by including provisions stating that:\\n   l) All residential propeity is exempt so homeowners and renters will not be affected in any way by tliis measure.\\n   2) This measure makes no cliange to existing laws affecting the taxation or preservation of agricultural land.\\n    (i) MakenochangetoPropositionl3\\'sconstitutionalprovisionsrelatingtothel%\\n    limitation on propeity tax rates for all taxable real property so local property taxes on commercial and industrial property will continue to be among the lowest in tlie corintry after this measure is approved by voters.\\n    (j) Ensure stability for owners of small business properties by providing an exclusion for small commercial and industrial real property owners. The intent of this provision is to provide an exclusion that applies only to the true owners of small businesses and that large property owners shall be prevented from using the exclusion for their own benefit.\\n    (k) Defer reassessments for properties in which small businesses account for 50% or more of tlie occupied space until tlie 2025-2026 lien date to provide those small business tenants additional time to clioose tlie leasing option that works for them, recognizing that the impact of tliis measure will be different for eacli propeity, depending on how close the current assessment is to the fair market value and whether or not it qualifies for the small propeity exclusion for propeities with a fair market value of $3 million or less.\\n    (l) Encourage new and existing businesses to make new investments by eliminating the business tangible personal property tax on eqriipment and fixtures for small businesses and providing a $500,000 per year exen\\'iption for all other businesses. Tlie Legislature may not reduce tliis exemption, but it may increase it.\\n    (m)Provide greater equity in the taxation of commercial and industrial properties by\\n    assessing all of tl\\'iem based on their actual fair market value just like stait-tips and new commercial and industrial propeities that already are being assessed based on their actual fair market value. The intent is for all businesses to compete on a more level playing field and make sure all businesses are paying their share to support the schools and local communities from whicl\\'i tliey benefit.\\n    (n) Reqriire tl\\'ie Legislature, after conferring with a Task Force on Propeity Tax Administration, to provide by statute for the phase-in of reassessments of under-assessed commercial and industrial real propeities so tliat corinty assessors may effectively implement the new law. Such phase-in will begin witli the lien date for the 2022-23 fiscal year and occur over several years. Affected owners sliall only be obligated to pay the taxes based on the new assessed value begii\\'uiing with the lien date for the fiscal year wlien tlie assessor has completed the reassessment.\\n    (o) Require the Legislature to ensure tliat the phase-in provisions provide affected owners of under-assessed commercial and industrial real propeities reasonable time to pay any increase in tlieir tax obligations resulting from this measure.\\n    (p) Provide for the recovery of actual direct administrative costs incuned by counties to effectively implement tlie new law.\\n     (q) Ensure that the General Fund and other \\'funds of the State are held harmless by reimbursing the State for reductions in tax revenue carised by the deductibility of the property tax.\\n     (r) Maintain the Board of Equalization\\'s oversiglit over the property tax system to assure the public that assessments of commercial and industrial real property in every corinty are equitable and uniform as required by this measure, and to further ensure that the Board of Equalization provides statewide assistance as necessary to support the efficient implementation of tliis measure within all 58 counties.\\n     SEC. 4.
